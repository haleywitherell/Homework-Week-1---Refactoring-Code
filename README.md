# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

Project Overview:

The client wanted the code to be refactored to follow accessibility standards so the website is optimized for search engines. Below you will see the changes I made to the code to improve the structure of the html and CSS. 

HTML:

I started off by giving the website a Title. It was originally “website” but I updated it to the name of the company Horiseon.

Next I got rid of all of the div tags and split the html code into sections. I added a header, footer and split up the main content of the site into smaller sections. 

Finally I added line breaks in the html to define each section more clearly. This didn’t change anything in the code but improved the flow and made the code easier to follow. 


CSS:

I updated the CSS so all three navigation bar links work.

I consolidated all of the classes that were exactly the same. 

I removed the header and footer classes as they only applied to the one element and were not needed.
